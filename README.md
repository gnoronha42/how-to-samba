# 🥁 How to Samba

Welcome to **How to Samba**! 🇧🇷

Brazil is a land of rich culture, vibrant rhythms, and an abundance of joy. Yet, this spirit often doesn't get the spotlight it deserves in the digital world. **How to Samba** is here to change that. We are a collective of creative Brazilians who believe in bringing the unique energy of our culture to the global stage.

## 🌎 Our Mission

At **How to Samba**, we are passionate about showcasing Brazil's diverse culture and its contributions to the global community. We believe in the power of creativity and the importance of thinking globally while acting locally. Through our projects, we aim to foster connections, share stories, and create a more harmonious world.

## 🎨 What We Do

Since 2015, we've been sharing the bright side of Brazil online. What began as a love for our culture has grown into a platform that bridges cultures and connects people. By 2016, we expanded our mission to guide and collaborate with global projects, helping to build lasting relationships across borders.

## 🛠️ Technologies

This project is built with:

- ⚛️ **React** - A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- 🧩 **Ant Design (antd)** - A design system for enterprise-level products.
- 🚀 **Vercel** - A platform for frontend developers, providing fast and secure hosting.

## 💡 Why We Samba

**How to Samba** is more than just a project—it's a movement. We are a house of creativity, where like-minded individuals come together to explore and expand the boundaries of what's possible. We believe that with creativity (and a little help from technology), there's no challenge we can't samba through.

## 🤝 Join Us

We invite you to join our creative journey. Let's build a world where Brazilian culture takes its rightful place in the global spotlight, contributing to the harmony of an ever-globalizing world.
